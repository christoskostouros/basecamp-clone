# Netlify Deployment Guide for Basecamp Clone

This guide will walk you through deploying your Basecamp clone application to Netlify from your GitHub repository.

## Prerequisites

- [x] GitHub repository created and code pushed
- [x] Clerk account with application configured
- [x] Neon PostgreSQL database set up
- [ ] Netlify account (free tier is sufficient)

## Step 1: Connect GitHub Repository to Netlify

1. **Go to Netlify Dashboard**
   - Visit [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and sign up/log in
   - Click "Add new site" â†’ "Import an existing project"

2. **Connect GitHub**
   - Click "Deploy with GitHub"
   - Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub account
   - Select your `basecamp-clone` repository

3. **Configure Build Settings**
   ```
   Branch to deploy: main
   Build command: bun run build
   Publish directory: .next
   ```

4. **Advanced Build Settings** (click "Show advanced")
   ```
   Functions directory: netlify/functions (leave empty for now)
   ```

## Step 2: Add Environment Variables

In the Netlify dashboard for your site:

1. Go to **Site settings** â†’ **Environment variables**
2. Click **"Add a variable"** for each of the following:

### Required Environment Variables

```env
# Clerk Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_HERE
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE

# Clerk URLs (use your actual Netlify domain)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_FORCE_REDIRECT_URL=/dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_FORCE_REDIRECT_URL=/dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_ORGANIZATION_PROFILE_URL=/organization-profile
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_CREATE_ORGANIZATION_URL=/create-organization
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_USER_PROFILE_URL=/user-profile

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@hostname/database?sslmode=require

# WebSocket (optional - for real-time features)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=https://your-socket-server.com
```

### Getting Your Values

**Clerk Keys:**
1. Go to clerk.com/dashboard
2. Select your application
3. Go to **API Keys** in the sidebar
4. Copy the **Publishable key** and **Secret key**
5. Make sure you're using the **production keys** (they start with pk_live_ and sk_live_)

**Database URL:**
1. Go to console.neon.tech
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Connection Details**
4. Copy the connection string (make sure it includes ?sslmode=require)

## Step 3: Deploy

1. After adding all environment variables, click **"Deploy site"**
2. Wait for the build to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)
3. Your site will be available at https://[random-name].netlify.app

## Step 4: Configure Custom Domain (Optional)

1. In Netlify dashboard, go to **Domain settings**
2. Click **"Add custom domain"**
3. Enter your domain name
4. Follow the DNS configuration instructions

## Step 5: Update Clerk Settings

1. In your Clerk dashboard, go to **Domains**
2. Add your Netlify domain (e.g., https://your-app.netlify.app)
3. Go to **Webhooks** and update any webhook URLs if needed

## Step 6: Test Your Deployment

1. Visit your deployed site
2. Test user registration/login
3. Create an organization
4. Test project and task creation
5. Verify real-time features work

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check the **Deploy log** in Netlify for specific error messages
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Verify environment variables are set correctly

### Authentication Issues
- Double-check Clerk keys are production keys
- Verify all Clerk URLs point to your Netlify domain
- Check that Organizations feature is enabled in Clerk

### Database Connection Issues
- Verify DATABASE_URL includes ?sslmode=require
- Check that your Neon database allows connections
- Test database connection locally first

### Runtime Errors
- Check the browser console for client-side errors
- Verify all environment variables are set in Netlify
- Make sure you're using the correct Clerk configuration

## Updating Your Deployment

Whenever you push changes to your `main` branch:
1. Netlify will automatically trigger a new build
2. The build will take 2-3 minutes
3. Your site will be updated automatically

## Environment Variables Checklist

- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- [ ] `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL`
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL`
