## Deployment Steps

1. **Access Netlify Dashboard**
   - Go to https://app.netlify.com/
   - Navigate to site: `same-3z3tp0mivhx-latest`

2. **Add Environment Variables**
   - Site Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add all variables from the list above
   - Set scope to "All scopes" or minimum "Production"

3. **Trigger Redeploy**
   - Deploys tab → Trigger deploy → Deploy site
   - Wait for deployment to complete

## Post-Deployment Testing

### ✅ Authentication Flow
- [ ] Visit https://same-3z3tp0mivhx-latest.netlify.app
- [ ] Click "Sign In" - should redirect to Clerk sign-in
- [ ] Test sign-up flow
- [ ] Verify dashboard access after authentication
- [ ] Test sign-out functionality

### ✅ Database Connection
- [ ] Dashboard loads without errors
- [ ] API routes respond correctly
- [ ] Real-time features work (if implemented)

### ✅ Protected Routes
- [ ] `/dashboard` requires authentication
- [ ] `/projects` requires authentication  
- [ ] `/tasks` requires authentication
- [ ] `/team` requires authentication

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"Clerk publishable key not found"**
   - Check environment variable name spelling
   - Ensure redeploy completed after adding variables

2. **Database connection errors**
   - Verify DATABASE_URL format
   - Check Neon database is active and accessible

3. **Redirect loops**
   - Verify Clerk URL configurations match routes
   - Check middleware.ts is properly configured

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check environment variables (locally)
bun run dev

# Build and test locally
bun run build
bun run start

# Check Netlify deployment logs
netlify dev
```

## Success Criteria

The deployment is successful when:
- ✅ Site loads without errors
- ✅ Authentication works end-to-end

- ✅ Dashboard displays correctly
- ✅ No console errors related to Clerk or database

## Next Steps After Successful Deployment
